### Welcome

Welcome to this website. Before we start, we need to clarify some things:

- Yes, I don't have to pay to create this website. All of the software part comes [Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#Free_software) of cost (except for the internet & my time, obviously)
- There is nothing called *Free Bear* (Yes, there is a price, **Always**. But, you might not get that at first glance)
- The ingredients are
  - A *workable* computer
  - An internet connection
  - A slice of patience with copy-paste (`ctrl-c + ctrl-v`) capability

The following Softwares are being used to create this website:

- A Linux OS ([Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) Cinnamon edition suits right for me)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ([64-bit LTS version compatible with Linux Mint](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.13.1/node-v12.13.1-linux-x64.tar.xz))
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) ([64-bit compatible with Linux Mint](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb))

The awesome websites (or we should say, *Web Services*), that make it alive:

- [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

#### Let's start
